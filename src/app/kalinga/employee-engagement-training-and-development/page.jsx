      <h1>Employee Engagement, Training, & Development</h1>

      <p>We fully recognize that engagement, learning,
        and development are vital for our employees to
        realize their full potential. As such, we strive to
        provide the requisite competencies and skills
        for them to succeed in their roles, to increase
        productivity, and produce a stable pool of talent
        for future leadership opportunities. </p>

      <p>Upskilling and reskilling gained heightened
        importance in 2022 with the growing shifts
        in the way business is done. It became an
        imperative strategy for companies to enhance
        their learning and development programs to
        respond to the emerging needs of business.</p>

      <Image style={{ borderRadius: '0' }} src="/page/training_hours2.png" width={398} height={186} alt='Training Hours' />

      <p>In 2022, our employees logged a total of over
        593,000 learning hours, up by 88% compared
        to the previous year. Online learning increased
        when CHR partnered with LinkedIn Learning
        and Udemy, which allowed training and
        development to expand its reach Groupwide.
        Learning administrators in each business unit
        were trained to do content curation to develop
        learning pathways in the LinkedIn Learning
        platform. These learning pathways were
        assigned to identified employees for completion,
        resulting in more than 238,000 content
        completions on the platform. Learning in groups
        also increased as sessions on the platform
        were conducted in larger forums to create a
        sense of community among employees in our
        plants and sales facilities. Onboarding and
        learning conversations were made available as
        well using online collaboration tools such as
        Microsoft Teams and Zoom.</p>

      <p>The development of high-potential and high-performing employees is a particular focus area
        in SMC. In addition to purposive career paths,
        coaching and mentoring, there are advanced
        learning programs where these employees
        can further hone their skills. These are the
        following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Management Development Program (MDP),
            run by Corporate HR;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Leadership and Management Development
            Program (LMDP), run by the Ateneo Graduate
            School of Business;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Executive Management Development
            Program (EMDP), run by the Asian Institute of
            Management; and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>ExecOnline, run by globally recognized
            institutions such as the Columbia School of
            Business and the University of California
            Berkeley.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>These programs provide leadership
        development and continuous learning
        opportunities and have become a laboratory of
        novel ideas, producing capstone projects that
        are high-impact and relevant, and promoting
        themes related to sustainability, innovation, and
        future of work. Despite pandemic constraints,
        hybrid learning allowed managers based
        outside of Metro Manila and from offshore
        facilities to participate in meaningful learning
        experiences. Participants were able to
        collaborate and appreciate the synergies that
        came out of class discussions, workshops, and
        case studies. The MDP, which is geared toward
        high-potential supervisors and team leaders
        across SMC, has 148 graduates since 2017.
        LMDP has a total of 23 batches since 2016,
        EMDP has 3 since 2018, and ExecOnline has
        one since 2019, for a total of 660 graduates who
        have completed the more advanced courses.
        For 2022, the programs produced 120 projects
        related to San Miguel’s sustainability programs
        such as plant-based butter, and biocoal from
        spent grains as a source of energy for plant
        facilities.</p>

      <p>Apart from leadership and work-related
        competencies, programs are also offered for
        holistic well-being, health, and creative talent
        development. These are in the form of webinars,
        individual consultation, interest groups, and
        even internal competitions. </p>

      <p>Finally, we conduct employee volunteer
        programs that help cultivate an engaged
        workforce, such as Volunteers in Action
        program by Petron, visitation to Saguitlang
        pupils by NCC, and various employee-initiated
        programs in provincial locations.

      <h3 className='orange'>Apart from leadership

      <p>Performance reviews are an important
        mechanism to drive the achievement of
        business goals and strategic initiatives. Given
        agreed goals at the start of the year, the
        employee’s performance is rated objectively
        based on the achievement of these goals by
        year-end. Also included in the review is an
        assessment of the employee’s strengths
        and areas for development, as well as
        developmental plans. For officers, middle
        managers, and non-unionized rank and file
        employees, the performance rating becomes the
        basis for salary increases in the following year.
        For unionized employees, salary increases are
        governed by their CBAs; nevertheless, some of
        them still undergo performance reviews.</p>


      <Image style={{ borderRadius: '0' }} src="/page/JOB_CATEGORY.png" width={717} height={213} alt='Job Category ' />




      <p>While performance reviews are expected to be
        completed for all officers, middle managers,
        and non-unionized employees, the actual
        compliance rate is still below standard. Between
        women and men, a higher percentage of women
        undergo performance reviews. To facilitate the
        performance review process, San Miguel piloted
        the use of SAP Success Factors as its platform
        for human capital management in 2018 and has
        progressively increased both the application
        modules activated and the organizational units
        migrated to the platform. The goal of HR is not
        only to attain a comprehensive coverage of
        performance reviews, but also to enhance its
        value as a motivational and developmental tool. </p>

      <p>Moving forward, one of our imperative
        development tasks is to raise awareness and
        build capability for sustainability among our
        employees across the Group. We are working on
        a combination of internal and external programs
        to equip our employees in ESG, including setting
        up a knowledge platform to serve as a groupwide repository of ESG resources and data and
        launching employee engagement programs to
        instill an ESG mindset in our workforce.</p>

      <p>For over a century, SMC has built a
        legacy of creating world-class products
        that are recognized globally. To achieve
        this, the company recognizes that its
        employees are its most valuable asset,
        and investing in them is key to excellence,
        innovation, and quality. That is why SMC
        has established in-house schools for its
        employees across various business units
        to develop specialized skills, keep up with
        industry trends, and drive innovation.
      </p>

      <Image style={{ borderRadius: '0' }} src="/page/JOB_CATEGORY2.png" width={717} height={198} alt='Job Category 2' />

      <p>One such in-house school is the San Miguel School
        of Brewing, which has been the primary institute
        for developing future brewmasters, quality
        assurance professionals, technical specialists,
        and brewery engineers since its creation in 1975.
        The school has produced brewmasters and other
        key technical people, and today, it is an accredited
        provider for Continuing Professional Development
        (CPD) of the Professional Regulation Commission
        (PRC) Councils of Chemical Engineering,
        Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical
        Engineering. This means that employees not only
        gain the knowledge and skills needed to advance
        their careers but can also obtain necessary CPD
        credits to maintain their licenses.</p>
